# CampBand 🎵

> **A modern alternative client for Bandcamp** — Experience indie music discovery the way it should be.

CampBand is a Firefox extension that transforms Bandcamp into a sleek, Spotify-like music streaming experience. Browse artist discographies, explore albums, build playback queues, and save your favorites — all wrapped in a beautiful dark theme with Apple-inspired liquid glass effects.

No more clunky page reloads or scattered tabs. Just smooth, seamless music browsing.
